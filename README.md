This is an app to view stations and journeys for Helsinki City Bikes during the summer of 2021.

The database is PostgreSQL database hosted on Railway. Railway is a really easy one-click solution for hosting databases.

You can test the app here: https://city-bike-app.vercel.app/

If you want to build the project locally: 1. download the source code 2. npm install 3. npm run build 4. npm start

If you want to run tests locally: 1. download the source code 2. npm install 3. npm run test

Whether you can to run or test locally, make sure to copy two .env files to the project root. These files will be provided in a zip-file with the application.

Hope you enjoy trying it out!
