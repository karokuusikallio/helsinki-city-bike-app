This is an app to view stations and journeys for Helsinki City Bikes during the summer of 2021. The project is build with Next.js because it is a fast but robust way to build a fullstack app from scratch only with Typescript and host in on Vercel. The database is PostgreSQL database hosted on Railway. Railway is a really easy one-click solution for hosting databases.
